        <p class="card-text">The global shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) is gaining momentum as governments and consumers become increasingly concerned about climate change and air pollution. EVs offer several advantages over traditional gasoline-powered cars, including lower emissions, reduced fuel costs, and quieter operation. However, challenges such as battery range, charging infrastructure, and higher upfront costs remain to be addressed.</p>

The Spanish introduced Catholicism, established a centralized government, and developed infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. However, the colonial period also brought suffering, including forced labor, exploitation, and loss of cultural identity.</p>

        <p class="card-text author">Kirisuchan Desu!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">Many of us, at some point in our lives, have faced the harsh reality of being compared to others. It’s a wound that often cuts deepest when we’re at our lowest. In those moments of vulnerability, a voice inside whispers, “I’m not enough. They are better than me.” We begin to question our worth, asking ourselves, “Who am I to judge, to stand out, to be worthy?”</p>
        <p class="card-text">But here’s the real question: Do we need to be better than anyone else? Some will say no, insisting that we are unique, incomparable. “You are you,” they say, “and that is enough.” Others argue yes, that the pursuit of being better is essential for personal growth, that it gives us a goal to strive towards, a reason to push forward.</p>
        <p class="card-text">But why? Why must we measure ourselves against others? Why can’t we grow on our own terms, in our own way? No human is perfect; we all need guidance, a compass to navigate the uncertain waters of life. But why are we so consumed with the future, with what might be? The future is unpredictable, unknowable. It cannot be crafted or controlled with certainty. So, why do we allow it to dictate our present?</p>
        <p class="card-text">Perhaps the answer lies not in being better than others, but in being better for ourselves—embracing our flaws, our strengths, our journey. The future will come, whether we obsess over it or not. What truly matters is who we choose to be right now.</p>
